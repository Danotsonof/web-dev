Learnt how the internet works, what happens when we type in a website site in the browser.

The wired and wireless connections of the internet space.

used tracert on my windows pc to check the trips to a server.

History of WWW with her transition over the years.

Wrote my first HTML code and my first website.

The web address of my web pages use the file protocol,
"file:///C:/Users/*xoxo*/Documents/soft/web-dev/index.html"
i also understood the existence of absolute and relative path.

Did some html practice and them had my break.

I resumed after my break to learning the operation of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
For quick help on property I found css-tricks.com very helpful and for color selection, palentton.com is the site to go.
